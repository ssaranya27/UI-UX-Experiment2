### Aim:
To design a basic mobile and web layout for an existing case study by applying
Gestalt principles, UI design patterns, and interaction behaviours, along with
creating a brand logo using Canva.

### Algorithm:
Apply Gestalt principles to enhance mobile and web layout design.
Incorporate UI elements and design patterns into the layouts. Develop
interaction behaviours and usability principles for the designs. Create a brand
logo using Canva, following styling and branding guidelines and include it with
your layouts.
### Output:
CASE STUDY FOR DESIGNING A PHARMA COMPANY
## Q1. How can Gestalt principles be applied to enhance mobile and web layout
design?
Gestalt principles improve visual perception and user experience. Examples:
• Proximity: Group related items (like menu links or product cards)
together.
• Similarity: Keep similar elements consistent in color, shape, or style.
• Continuity: Align elements so the eye naturally follows the flow.
• Closure: Use shapes or borders to suggest connections between
elements.
• Figure-Ground: Ensure important content stands out from the
background.
## Q2. How do you incorporate UI elements and design patterns into the
layouts?
UI elements and patterns make the layout intuitive and consistent:

• Navigation Menus: Top bar, sidebar, or hamburger menus for easy
navigation.
• Cards & Sections: Display content modularly for clarity.
• Buttons & CTAs: Clearly styled and positioned for user actions.
• Forms & Inputs: Well-labeled fields with proper spacing.
• Design Patterns: Use common patterns like tabbed content, sliders, or
modals for predictability.
## Q3. How are interaction behaviours and usability principles developed in the
designs?
Interaction and usability enhance user engagement:
• Hover & Click Effects: Indicate interactable elements.
• Responsive Layouts: Adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet,
desktop).
• Clear Navigation Flow: Users can easily move from one section to
another.
• Accessibility: High contrast, readable fonts, and keyboard-friendly
navigation.
• Feedback: Show messages on form submission, button clicks, or errors.

## Q4. How do you create a brand logo using Canva and include it in your
layouts?
1. Open Canva and choose a logo template.
2. Select colors, fonts, and icons consistent with the brand’s identity.
3. Customize text and graphics to reflect the brand’s theme.
4. Download the logo in PNG format for high quality.
5. Insert the logo into the layout (typically in the header or footer) to
maintain branding consistency.
